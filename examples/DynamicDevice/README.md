# Dynamic device
Example of device able to change declared values while running

### Remarks
Plans are to prepare systematic solution for this concept in the future,
as current system capabilities does not allow proper pipe handling in such case.
For now, considered as test for restarting connection programmatically

### Values
**Main**
- All values added by user

**Settings**
- New value name - name for added value
- New value type - type for added value
- Add - button that adds new value as configured

### Setup
Open terminal under project's root directory and run "npm run device:dynamic"
